# machine_learning

This repository contains all the practising materials while learning basic machine learning algorithms.

- KNN
- Logistic Regression
- DNN
- CNN
- GCN
- Comparison of commonly-used machine learning frameworks including Tensorflow, Pytorch and Sci-kit Learn

For better to learn how machine learning works, some basic models are built from scratch with numpy and pandas.

Tensorflow, Pytorch and Sci-kit Learn for deep learning.
